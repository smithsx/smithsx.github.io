        <h1>SQL Fundamentals</h1><br>
        <h4>Overview</h4><br>
        <p>Utilizing the book <u>SQL Queries for Mere Mortals</u> the class is intended for introducing and getting students comfortable with common
        SQL queries, tools, and best practices. The course is by no means exhaustive, and not all of the book is used as the course is moreso a beginning to 
        database queries, and not a path to master. The basics of a relational database are covered. The student is then guided step by step on different keywords
        such as SELECT, FROM, and using aliases; utilizing logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT; the differences between INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN,
        and when to use them; and we can't forget our filtering words such as WHERE, HAVING, BETWEEN, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY. I am sure I missed a keyword or two, but this
        would be the majority of the course in these keywords.

    <h4>Reflection</h4><br>
    <p>Any tool worth its salt is going to be collecting, storing, and sending data. That data is going to be stored in some sort of database, and when that
        software tool is being used, the code running in it will be doing database queries. For me to be successful in my career, especially if I want to be 
        building useful apps, I have to understand what is going on within a database, what I am searching for, and how I need to search for it. This will save me time
        coding in the long run. Since some career option include the weather industry, the gaming industry, or places like Instructure Canvas, I have to know these fundamentals.
        I had taken a database course previously in my college career, but that focused on it from an admin view. So there was more about the inner workings and 
        how to normalize the tables. This course, SQL Fundamentals, was more hands on and practical since it is something I can and likely will be utilizing from the 
        start of my career.
