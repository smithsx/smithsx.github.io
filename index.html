        <h2>About Me</h2><br>
        <p>I am a veteran Marine with a range of knowledge and skills going into meteorology, culinary arts, information
            technology, and now software development.
            I am someone that like to solve problems, but moreso create tools to make normals tasks easier or quicker.
            That said, I am wanting to get into software
            development for the purpose of creating applications and other software to make common, and even very niche,
            tasks something that doesn't require much thinking.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>What you can find here on my E-portfolio</h2><br>
        <p>Here I have included an overview of courses I have taken and how the knowledge I have gained from them make
            me a suitable choice for employment.
            I have also included pages with working web based projects I have completed and links to my github
            repository for projects that don't play in a web browser.
            I will, however, include screenshots and video for some of those github projects in this e-portfolio to give
            you an idea of what you would be looking at.
        </p>
