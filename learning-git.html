    <h1>Version Control Fundamentals</h1><br>
    <h4>Overview</h4><br>
    <p>What is Version Control? How long has it been around and how have the various iterations of it worked? And why Git? These questions are what start off the course
        so that not only do we know why version control systems are so important, but what makes Git stand out among them. The difference between snapshots and deltas,
         what is branching, what makes it so cool, why you should do it early and often, merging vs rebasing and the dangers of rebasing, and so on. The class is also very hands
          on as we get to learn the basics of Git on the command line by manipulating a small repository, then with a GUI using SourceTree and BitBucket, and again with a 
          GUI using Visual Studio.

    <h4>Reflection</h4><br>
    <p>Prior to taking this class I knew of GitHub and Git, but I had no practical experience with them, or knowledge of how they really worked. 
        My practice of version control was a folder where I built and tested changes, and a folder where I kept the final functionality. Now that I have
         knowledge of Git and its version control processes, I have no intent on returning back to that. I love the fact I can branch to test functionality.
          If it works, I merge it. If it doesn't, I delete the branch with no risk to my main code. It is easier to roll back changes if needed, rather than just 
          manually deleting or adding lines of code to a file or files. I also like the redundancy aspect of it, where I have a local copy of the entire repo and 
          I can have the repo in a cloud, or another computer, or just on another storage device in general and with ease I can clone from one of them if necessary. 
          I can easily see how this is absolutely necessary knowledge and experience in the industry, but even for my classes here where I build small apps in one 
          lesson and then modify it the next, branching is going to be my friend for years to come.
