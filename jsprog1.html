        <h1>Javascript Programming 1</h1><br>
        <h4>Overview</h4><br>
        <p>Utilizing the Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/">"Modern Javascript (Complete Guide, from Novice to Ninja)"</a> 
        the course takes you from the history of Javascript, to basics like the difference between variable types (i.e. var vs. let vs. const), all the way up to doing API calls,
    using tools like Babel to ensure browser compatibility, OOP including prototypes and classes, and so on. Every section involved building some simple app with the things you 
learn and in a couple cases, modifying it later on. The staff at the school would then challenge the student on top of that, requiring changes or added functionality to what was built
requiring the student to think and research to find how to get that done. After one of the sections involving class construction, we had to reverse engineer what the video took
us through to where it functioned the same without being in a Class.

<h4>Reflection</h4><br>
<p>I had fun and frustration, as I have had before with any programming attempt. The early parts of the class were familiar to me, having done a web development
    class before, along with being the web programmer for a small student organization, and having attempted to learn a thing like Python on my own. However, there was a 
    lot of the course content that was new to me. While I may have learned about some like the 'this' keyword by having to work with a previously written script, I did not
    know much about API calls, JSON, and a lot of other interactivity that you come to take for granted on a lot of other web pages. So getting to build a basic web application
    with API calls to the Accuweather API was fun. I also go to learn some of the very
    basics of nodeJS, how to better use the DOM, and the inner workings of Classes and prototypes within Javascript. While I don't really plan to be a web developer, the things
    I learned here are very applicable in other languages, and Javascript has uses outside of the browser too.
